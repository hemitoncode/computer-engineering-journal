## Cosine Similarity

### Introduction:
Tomorrow is the test! I am really nervous for it, but I know I have prepared well for it. Today's class also consisted of working on practice problems (of which I did all of them), so I spent some time learning more about AI stuff and helped my peers to strengthen my own understanding on circuits. 

### Learning/Reflections:
Cosine similairty is a way to calculate how similar the direction of 2 vectors are. It is the direct calculation of cosine which serves the exact function. However, the formula which is used to calculate cosine similiary does not need an angle of theta, which saves much needed computation. 

This is needed in my AI system because the direction tells us how closely related two vectors are (and by extension the words which those vectors represent). So, if the 2 vectors are closley rate (almost at 1 cosine) and the reference vector which I used to compare was for immigration policy, my text was likely for immigration political concept.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned about the magic behind cosine similairty.
