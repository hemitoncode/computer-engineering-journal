## More practice on breadboarding

### Introduction:
Today I learned about how RGB lights work. 

### Learning/Reflections:
I learned how that the red, green, and blue parts of the LED run through different pins. I can control the brightness of each of these colors by attaching resistors to each pin or apply different voltages. This allows me to create unique colors thorough the blending of the 3 colors. In addition, I learned about the difference between common cathode and anode. Common cathode means the RGB runs through the - flow of the current while common anode means there is a + flow of the current. 

### Conclusion:
This has increased my understanding of different electrical components which I can use in my circuits.
