### Introduction:
Today, we did MORE practice on circuit analysis. I was pretty confident in my abilities to do it, so I decided to write on an interesting article that I read.

### Learning/Reflections:
I continued with my interest in AI and building systems with a good understanding of it. Today, I read a blog on centriod vectors. A centriod vector is where data points are grouped together based on thier similarity in meaning (which is recorded in the vector embedding). This is needed in my app because I am trying to classify text into different political concepts. By having reference vectors for a topic like economy, the centriod vector creates a single point of reference for my text to compare with through another cool concept called **cosine similarity** (will learn more tomorrow!)

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned about centriod vectors and understood how I can engineer my system with them in it!
