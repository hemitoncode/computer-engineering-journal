## Is there more then perfboards??

### Introduction:
Today, I spent some time working on my night light sensor. Since I have away for so long, I got the winter break to solder everything in. While working, I was wondering if there is more to soldering then perfboards, and there is!
### Learning/Reflections:
Perfboard is one of many ways to solder components in. Professional circuits are often made through PCB (printed circuit boards) where connections to different components are pre-made. All you need to do is put the components in thier assigned holes and solder them with the pad given. Therefore, you do not need to create connections with other solder joints. In fact, if you do that (through solder bridging), there is a huge likelihood that you short the circuit leading to a broken flow of current. 

To design a PCB (the connections needed), you use a CAD software (allows you to create 2d and 3d designs). Some popular softwares include **Altium Desktop** or **Autodesk Fusion** (formerly EAGLE).
You can then submit a file of your design to a PCB priting service such as PCBWay. 

## Solder bridge on PCB (BIG NO NO!!):

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned that you can create a soldered circuit not only through perfboards, but also through PCBs.
