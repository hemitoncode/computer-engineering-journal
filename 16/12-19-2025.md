## IC

### Introduction:
Today, I start a new project (bonus) for Mr. C! It will need implementation of ICs.

### Learning/Reflections:
IC means integrated circuit. It is a component just like a push button or a resistor, but it combines many components within itself to perform complex calculations. The main benefit of implementing these circuits is that it allows you to do complex things with smaller space.    

There can be many IC which do a diverse amount of functions. An example of such is... 
#### 7473 IC

The 7473 IC stores bits of data, allowing you to create an incrementer system because you can change the amount of bits that it stores which can be representative of a 10-base numerical value.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, ICs make it easier to create circuits in a smaller manner, allowing us to create more advanced pieces of tech!
