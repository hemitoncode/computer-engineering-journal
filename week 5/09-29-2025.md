## Computer Safety

### Introduction:
Since we have a good understanding of the different components that the computer holds, it is now time to break down a computer. Before we can do this, it is important to understand some basic safety to ensure our computer doesn't break and we aren't hurt. 

### Learning/Reflection:
To start, we need to avoid exposing our internal components to static electricity. If they are exposed to it, the components might get shocked and stop functioning. Since humans can accmulate static electricity through friction within our environment, it is necessary to use preventative measures before cracking a computer open.

This measure is the anti-static wrist brand/band. It needs to be clipped onto an unpainted surface (as paint is not conductive). This way the static electricity is grounded, and it doesn't pose a threat to the component. If this band is not available, touch a metal surface. 

Mr.C also stressed the importance of staying organized with your tools and components. Ensure that your screws are put away in the proper containers, because if they are not, the screws might get lost due to their tiny size. 

You also should keep the components on an electrostatic bag or place them **gently** on the an anti-static surface. 

Also touch components from the edges so you do not damage the critical components. 

Keep your PC off when tearing it down so that components like fans are switched off and are not damaged by human intervention. 

If you do get hurt, **report to Mr.C** and wash the wound with soap and water to avoid an infection as the metals are untreated and dirty.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned how to stay safe when breaking down a computer.
