## Exploration of The Computer (I/O Shields)

### Introduction:
Today, Mr.C conducted a through tutorial on how to disassemble a PC. 

### Learning/Reflection:
When Mr.C was going through all the parts, one stood out to me, **the I/O shield.** Initially, I had no clue what it was, but after doing some of my own research and Mr.C's lecture, I gained a good understanding of it. A I/O shield is a thin piece of metal that snaps into the back of a computer case. It's main job is to protect the I/O ports (HDMI, USB, Ethernet, etc) from being damaged by dust collection. It also covers a gap in the motherboard which ensures that tiny insects or small objects do not gain access to the motherboard (where the I/O shield is located at). It also labels all these ports, so the user can plug cables into the right part of the computer. 

### Images of I/O Shields:

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned the importance of the I/O shield.
