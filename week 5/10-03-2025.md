## Edge AI (Embedded Systems)

### Introduction:
Today was the Terry Fox walk. As such, there was no work period to continue disassembling the PC, so I decided to write a reflection on an article I read. 

### Learning/Reflection:
TinyML is the field that focuses on helping machine learning stuff work on smaller, less powerful machines. This is needed when we want to integrate AI-like services to devices like IoT (internet of things) or appliances like a fridge. Edge AI is a product within this space. Engineers are attempting to create models that can run directly on the local computer (*edge*) through optimizing AI models to become less resource intensive. This means faster decisions because you do not need to request a response from the server. You would get it from your computer itself. They will specifically run these Edge AI models through optimized runtimes which will allow them to become less resource hungry. An example of it is Edge TPU runtime. Normal AI uses big numbers to compute a response, but the Edge TPU will shrink these numbers down through the process of quantization, so that it uses less memory.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, Edge AI is a part of TinyML and will change the way AI will work!
