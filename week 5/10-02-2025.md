## Removing the Computer: Bit by Bit. BE ORGANIZED!

### Introduction:
Today, me and my group member/friend, Kunj, started disassembling a 2012 Acer tower PC. 

### Learning/Reflection:
One thing we learned from that experience was the the importance of being organized. Though Mr.C emphaized this in previous lessons, seeing the importance of it in practice was much more educational/impactful. When we first started, we didn't really think about being organized and that led to our tools and wires going missing. For example, we misplaced our screw driver and spent about 10 minutes looking for it. This forced us to waste time leading to less things being done during the class period. Thankfully, I realized this error in our way of working and immediately implemented a solution. From that point on, all of our tools were placed in predictable places within our workspace. I used some goose paper to create different labels for screwdrivers, VGA/DVI cables, and computer components we were removing. By doing so, we could find the different things we needed to complete our jobs in a manner of seconds! 

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, be organized with the tools and stuff that you are working with when disassembling a PC.
