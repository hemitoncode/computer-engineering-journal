## Windsurf - AI Code Editor

### Introduction:
Today, we had the chance to update our journals. Since I was already updated with my journal, I decided to read an article and discuss my reflections here on Windsurf, a code editor with AI built in.

### Learning/Reflection:
Though VS Code (a very popular editor) does have CoPilot AI integrated, the user experience is subpar compared to other products like Cursor or **Windsurf**

I personally like Windsurf because its much cheaper to use and still provides an elegant developer experience. 

In the free tier, you get access to basic AI models like DeepSeek R1. When coding, you will use the panel on the right-hand side called Cascade which will allow you to generate code and modify files, increasing productivity as you don't have to copy and paste AI generated stuff into your codebase. It is important to craft your questions properly when using these tools as if you don't, the AI will go on crazy tangents and add unnecessary things. You can do this by pre-planning what you want the model to accomplish and double check the code it generates before accepting it into your codebase. 

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, Windsurf is a great product for building applications quick through the help of AI-assisted development.
