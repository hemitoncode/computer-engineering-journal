## The computer... Broken down!:

### Introduction:
Today, we delved even deeper into the different components of a computer through a research task assigned. Within our groups we had to research specific and in-depth questions about the CPU, RAM, Storage, PSU, GPU, and Case. 

## Learning/Reflection:
In the duration of my group's research effort, I found the answer as to why RAM data is so voltiatie. It is due to electrical charges (which represent different data through binary) in capacitors. Capacitors are electrical components which hold a charge, but for a very short duration of time. Therefore, they constantly need power to jolt them with electricity, helping them remember what their charge is. Static RAMs use another electrical component called a transistor. Transistors are part of a ciruit, so they need an electrical charge to function. In both cases, you need electricity for the RAM to hold its data. 

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned about capacitors and transistors which are vital components to storing data within Dynamic and Static RAMs.
