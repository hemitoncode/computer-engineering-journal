## Slowing down CPUs + A project!:

### Introduction:
Today, I learned the term "throttling" and what role it plays when a CPU overheats. A project (worth marks) was also introduced to us where we have to develop a game-based learning apporach to the different components within a computer. 

## Learning/Reflection:
During our class discussions, the term throttling came up. I had never heard of it before, so I decided to do some extended research and ask some questions to my peers and teacher. Eventually, I came to know that throttling means slowing down. In the context of overheating, it is used to slow the workload of a CPU. This way the CPU can start slowing down its operations, and therefore start cooling down. 

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, I started working on my project (brainstorming some ideas) and learned a new term within the realm of computing.
