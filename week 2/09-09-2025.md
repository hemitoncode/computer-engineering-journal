## The operations of a computer:

### Introduction:

The computer can be chunked into 4 blocks (things that they can do) which are known as *Input, Memory, Process, and Output*.

### Learning/Reflection

The following is an elaboration of the 4 blocks:

| Block       | Explanation                                                                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ***Input***   | The input is a set of instructions which are given to the computer by the user. |
| ***Memory***  | The memory is where all the information is stored. There is both temporary data (RAM) and permanent data (SSD or HDD). Electricity is used to transmit information, so it's on and off state (binary) is used to convey data like colors or pictures.   |
| ***Process*** | The sets of instructions are now processed through the CPU.              |
| ***Output***  | The final result that comes out of the computer, such as on a screen, printer, or speakers. |

An example of these blocks of operations is within the work a SELF-CHECKOUT KIOSK does.

| Block                | Example in Action                                                                |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Input**            | The barcode is scanned, sending instructions to find the price and product info. |
| **Temporary Memory** | The kiosk temporarily stores the scanned barcode.                                |
| **Permanent Memory** | The product database stores all product IDs with their associated information.   |
| **Process**          | The system looks up the product info from the database and calculates the total. |
| **Output**           | The screen displays the total and product details, and a receipt is printed.     |


### Conclusion 
In conclusion, I learned that the work of a computer can be broken down into 4 different components which are known as **Input, Memory, Process, and Output*

I loved the lesson!
