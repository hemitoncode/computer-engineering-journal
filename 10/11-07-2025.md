## Practice building on circuit

### Introduction:
Today, we practiced our circuit building skills on the breadboard using a software program called TinkerCAD.

### Learning/Reflections:

The 150 ohm resistor is connected in parallel to series with the two 50 ohm resistors and the 60 ohm resistor. The two 50 ohm resistors are in series with the 75 ohm resistor. That resistor is connected to the ground which creates a loop for current to flow through. 

The 60 ohm resistor is in series with the 40 ohm resistor which is connected to ground, closing the loop for current to flow through. 

The best way to determine whether 2 loads (resistors) are wired through parallel or series is to follow the path of current. If the current splits into different loads, they are **parallel**, but if they are in the same path of current between the 2 resistors, they are in series. 

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I applied my theoretical knowledge in circuits through breadboarding.
