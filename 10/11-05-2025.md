## Using TinkerCAD

### Introduction:
Today, we had a chance to explore the TinkerCAD platform in much more depth. 

### Learning/Reflections:
I already knew that TinkerCAD is a way to create simulations for circuits. We learned how to wire resistors/loads parallelly. To do so, you need to ensure the flow of current splits which will occur by wiring the resistors to one another in a solderless breadboard. This way, the total current has 2 places to go 


We also learned how to measure voltage, amps, and ohms through a **multi-meter**. When measuring voltage, you need to ensure the the circuit is live. When measuring amps, you need to ensure the circuit is live. When measuring ohms, you need to ensure circuit is NOT live.

You can control the power through a power supply which allows you shut down the power when the simluation is running.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned about how to wire a parrallel circuit through a breadboard, how to measure resistance, voltage, current.
