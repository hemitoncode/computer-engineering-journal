## More Practice + Workslop

### Introduction:
Today was just more practice for circuits. I am pretty confident in building them on TinkerCAD and solving them using the parallel and series rules + Ohm's law, so I decided to explore an article for today's journal entry.

### Learning/Reflections:

Many companies are rapidly adopting generative AI tooling to help with their workflow. Despite this adoption, one report from MIT media lab found that about 95 percent of organizations saw no proper return on their investments into AI. As such, people have now coined the term **"Workslop"**

This simply means "AI-generated work content that looks like great productive work, but lacks the substance to meaningfully help complete a given task.

Basically, AI tools can produced outputs quickly (e.g. slides, reports, code), but they are likely top be incomplete lack context, or are otherwise unhelpful as those asking the AI to generate the work do not know how to do it properly or like the background knowledge needed. 

AI is like a computer. It is only a rule following machine that is incapable of critical thought. It is up to the person prompting AI to give it the proper information needed for it to help automate **PARTS** of their work.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, be smart with how you use AI!
