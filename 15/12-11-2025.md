## Desoldering

### Introduction:
Today, I learned how to desolder using the soldering wick

### Learning/Reflections:
Soldering wick is a braided copper which absorbs your unwanted solder. Before you start, you need to apply flux on the joint. The joint oxidizes due to its interaction with the environment. This is harmful because it creates a thin non-conductive layer atop the joint, so the solder cannot properly be melted with the soldering iron. You use the wick by placing it on the soldering joint, heating the copper with the soldering iron, and letting the flux pull the melted solder onto the copper.

*PRO-TIP:*
Tin your soldering iron before heating the wick. Just like when applying solder, it will improve the heat transfer which will ensure the desoldering process can happen quicker and much better. Sometimes, residue solder is left. Though it cannot be FULLY removed, you can use a soldering sucker to clear most of it. The sucker works by melting the solder with the iron and then pressing a button to release a spring which will force the solder into the machine.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned how to proper desolder joints when I make undesirable connections. You should start off with the wick to remove the grunt of it, and the solder sucker gun **CAN** help to remove residues or smaller pieces of solder which were missed.
