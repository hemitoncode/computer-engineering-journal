## Working on the project more! Didn't learn much, so did a blog! 

### Introduction:
Today, I read an insightful explainer on the soldering robots. 

### Learning/Reflections:
Soldering robots are essentially automated systems designed to solder components on printed circuits with incredible precision and repeatability. These machines use integrated vision systems and software that can follow 3D models to guide their actions, a stark constracts to manual soldering which relies heavily on human skills and steadiness. 

They redefine what's possible: 
- A robot doesn't get tired, so quality stays consistent across thousands of connection.
- It can control temperature and movement in ways humans simply can't, minimizing defects that break products later.
- Robots also improve safety by reducing human exposure to heats and flux fumes (harmful)

There are some real challenges to this though:
- High upfront cost due to expensive software, expertise, and hardware
- Lots of space needed to implement this heavy machinary

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, robot arms MIGHT??? be the future!
