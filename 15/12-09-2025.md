## AI -> Does it truly exist

### Introduction:
Today, I dove into the fascinating world of AI and its true nature. 

### Learning/Reflections:
People often miscontrude AI's generative ability as it being a thinker or consicous entity. AI does not have feelings, intentions, or awareness. It cannot form opinons or have inner thoughts Instead all it does it predict what should come next based on examples of what it has already seen. So even it sounds super **smart**, it is just a mirror of human language. 


Many philopshers argue that one's existence is bound to their ability of thought. Humanity is able to do these with ease, so they do exist. AI cannot, thus from a philopsical and logical viewpoint, AI is just a machine, not something that should be given rights.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, today we looked into the philopshy behind AI systems.
