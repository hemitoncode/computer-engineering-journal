## Catch up - Transistor Introduction

### Introduction:
I was away the day we did the Transistor Introduction activity, so I decided to finish it to catch up on all my of engineering work. 

### Learning/Reflections:
I was unaware what the circuit was due to lack of context, so I asked Kush to explain everything. Once I understood the requirements for this project, I made a schematic using https://www.circuit-diagram.org/editor/.

I soldified my understanding of transistors, spefically NPN and the 3 pins they have (collector, base, emitter). The collector is where current enters the transistor, so it is important to use a resistor for this part if your non-restricted can get high (you do not want to blow out the transistor!). The base is the **control pin.** It allows the transistor to act as a switch by blocking the flow of current coming from collector when no current comes through it. Therefore, whatever is connected to the base must have a state in which current is cut. This can be done by adding a switch which completes flow of current by inserting a metal wire when pressed. **AND** finally the emitter is where the electrons leave the transistor. It is usually connected to the GND. 


With this understanding, I designed my circuit where the base had a switch which would block the current from entering the base. There are other parts which I will explain below:

The 2 resistors are connected parallely from the + end of battery because current splits between them. In this case evenly because both have = resistance. One of the current path only connects to a LED which is then connected to the collector of transistor (series since same flow of current). The other path is connected to LED and a switch which connects to base of transistor (series for same reason). The emitter is then conected to the negative part of the battery.

I also put this on a breadboard in TinkerCAD!

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I built an LED circuit with transistors for the first time!
