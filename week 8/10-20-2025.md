## The Basics of Circuits

### Introduction:
Today, I got caught up on the basics of circuits. I learned what electricity is, how a circuit works, loads, voltage, amps, and ohms (resistance). 

### Learning/Reflection:
Electricity is the flow of a charged particle (usually an electron). 

The circuit works by exerting a force/pressure which causes the flow of the electrons. The measure of this force is known as voltage. The speed at which this flow occurs is measured in amps. This flow is continuous and it causes energy to be created which is used by different components like LEDs or motor. This is also known as the load because it restricts the flow. Another type of load is resistors. They are measured in the unit of Ohms (Î©). 

If there isn't a load, the flow of electricity would be left unrestricted causing damage to the circuitry. 

**Types of electricity:**

- Static: electricity does not move at all
- Current: electricty moves *(this is what is used by circuits)*

**Ohm's Law:**
This law defines the relationship between the current (speed of flow of electricity/amps), resistance (ohms), and pressure of flow (voltage).

It states that when the voltage is constant, the amps is inversely proportional to the ohms  (amps increase/ohms decrease)

When the ohms/resistance is constant, the amps is proportional to the voltage (amps increase/voltage increase)

Here is a visual aid to help you work with Ohm's law. values beside each other are multiplying whilst when they are above (look like a fraction) it is division. Put a finger over the value you are trying to calculate and see whether you multiply or divide the other values to calculate it.

**I is the same as current**

Therefore,
- V = I x R
- I = V/R
- R = V/I

### Conclusion:
I am now an expert in the basic circuits :)
