## GUESS Method 

### Introduction:
I learned about the GUESS method which is used to solve basic circuit problems. I implemented them in a D2L online assignment that was completed in the classtime. 

### Learning/Reflection:
GUESS is an acronym which stands for the following:

**G**: Givens 

**U**: Unknowns

**E**: Equation

**SS**: Solve, Solve!

This is a problem solving method that is used to solve Ohm's law problems when we are given 2 of the following values: current (I), resistance (ohms), voltage (volts). You first figure out the 2 values that are given to you. Then figure out what we are looking for (unknown). Based off the givens and unknowns, find the equation through the **VIR triangle** which computes value for unknown. Then we substitue the values into the equation for your first solving step. The second solving step is calculations.  

### Example:
Whatâ€™s the resistance in a circuit with a .100 A resistor and a 12 Volt potential?

**G**: 
- Current: .100 A
- Voltage: 12 V

**U**:
- Resistance

**E**: 

R = V/I

**SS**:

R = 12 V/ .100 A
R = 120 ohms


Through the GUESS method, we solved this problem to be 120 ohms resistance. 

### Conclusion:
I learned how to use the GUESS method to solve Ohm's law style problems (good for when test comes).
