## Breadboarding

### Introduction:
Today we learned the importance of breadboarding and what it is. 

### Learning/Reflections:
Bread boards are used for prototyping and building temporary circuits, also known as proto-boards. It used to be nails on a board (used to cut bread) and wires were tangled around the nails to create a circuit. Modern day brad boards are plastic pieces and have metal clips underneath to allow electricity conduct. Wires are inserted through a hole meaning you can easily remove and add dirrection wires, making them perfect for prototyping/developing circuits. It is harder to correct a more permanent circuit like a PCB or soldered circuits because the connections are sewed on permanently. It is also used because2

Metal pieces run either horizontally and vertically and in each section electricty would run through those sections. If there is a +/- section marked on the board, but that is just for reference. You can have the + in the section meant for the -. However, it wouldn't be a best practice. 

Use the jumper wires are used to connect different components to the power supply. **YOU NEED TO USE A FEW JUMPER WIRES AND SHORT AS POSSIBLE** to keep the circuit clean and organized. 

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned everything that I need to become an proficient in breadboarding.
