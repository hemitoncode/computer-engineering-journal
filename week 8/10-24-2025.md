breadboard 

- it is used for prototyping/building temporary circuits
- it has metal pieces underneath it to allow electricity conduct 
- it used to be nails on a board used to cut bread (and wires on the nails to move electricity throughout the circuit)
- it is sometimes called proto-board
- the wires are inserted through a hole meaning you can easily remove and add different wires (no need for soldering)
- metal pieces run either horizontally and vertically and in each section electricity would run through those sections
- the +/- section are just used for reference. it's not a rule of thumb (just helps you build a cleaner circuit)
- jumper wires mean connections
- **USE AS FEW JUMPER WIRES AND SHORT AS POSSIBLE**
- they are used for time and money (much cheaper and faster to produce)
- it is harder to correct a PCB or soldered circuit because the connections are permanent
- use breadboard to see if the circuit is working properly before creating a PCB or soldered circuit
- place IC chips in the middle of the breadboard
