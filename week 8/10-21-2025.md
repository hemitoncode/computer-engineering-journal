## Circuits schematic

### Introduction:
Today we learned how to communicate the design of circuits through a unified language. It's the schematic which is like the "blueprint" or "map" of the circuitry. 

### Learning/Reflection:
Communication is key in engineering circuits, but it must be consistent to avoid any mistakes. This is why circuits schematics are used. Ensure that the wires which connect these components are straight lines, even if the actual circuit has the wires curved.

The most common components you will see are the following:

#### 1:

    This is the battery symbol. You usually draw 2 lines. One of them is smaller than the other one. The larger line will be the + (anode) and the shorter line is - (cathode). Label these sides as + and -, so that others reading your schematic know. Please add your voltage value beside the battery, so we know how much volts the circuit will experience.

    The resistor is drawn through clean zig zag lines. Ensure your work is clean and orderly so others know the exact component you drew. A resistor has non-polarity which means it does not matter which terminal (+/-) that you connect the resistor too. Please write the resistance value on the side of the resistor as the value and then the units of ohms (shown through Greek letter of omega).

    This is the symbol for the switch. It allows you to control the flow of electric current, so you can restrict when the switch is off and allow it when it is on. The open switch means the flow of the current is restricted, so the load won't recieve the energy needed for it to power on. The closed switch is the opposite, and <b>they must be shown differently</b>

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned the basics of how to design a circuit through schematics.
