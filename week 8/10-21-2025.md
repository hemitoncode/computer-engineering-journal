## Analogy of Circuits

### Introduction:
Today, we had a lesson on circuits. During a discussion with Mr.C, I learned the analogy of water hose and how that relates to the flow of electrons and circuits. 

### Learning/Reflection:

- The flow of water through the house represents the flow of electrons through a wire. Just as the water moves end to end, electrons move through the ciruit to carry energy.

- The pressure which causes the water to push through the house is the same as voltage. It is the force that moves electrons through the circuits. A higher voltage means a stronger push, just like higher water pressure pushes more water.

- If the hose is narrow or partially blocked, it is harder for water to flow. That is like resistance in circuits, which slows down or limits the flow of current.


This connected all the dots about the material. Circuits is a simply a flow of electrons, and it is this flow which creates the energy necessary to power the load. That is why you cannot have a proper circuit if all the wires are not connected properly because than the flow of electrons are also not connected properly. 

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I become more educated in the basics of circuitry.
