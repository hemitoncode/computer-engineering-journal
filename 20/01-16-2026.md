## Transistors with DC Motors

### Introduction:
Today, I learned how to use transistors to allow for the controlling of a DC motor on an external power supply.

### Learning/Reflection:
The transistor allows us to block the flow of current, making it a perfect device for controlling the DC motor through an Arduino pin. The DC motor, by default, cannot be powered through the Arduino board alone. It does not have sufficient current.

Therefore, it needs to be powered through an external power supply. That is easy enough, but you need to use Arduino digital pin in order to control the DC motors. This is where the transistor comes through. I use the NPN transistor which has 3 pins: *collector, base, and emitter*. 

**Base:** This is the control signal which powers the transistor on (allowing current flow). This is the site of wiring the digital pin. 
<br>
**Collector:** This is where the power comes in. Ir connects to the load (your DC motor).
<br>
**Emitter:** This pin is usually connected to the ground. When the transistor is on, current flows out of the emitter and back to ground.

It is **VERY** important that the external power supply shares the **SAME GROUND** as the Arduino board. Or else, the current of flow will **NOT BE COMPLETE**

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned how to use the Arduino with a transistor to develop products with a DC motor.
