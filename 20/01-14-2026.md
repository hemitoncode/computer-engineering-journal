## The I2C 

### Introduction:
Today, I hooked up a LCD display on my project. 

### Learning/Reflection:
Usually, there are MANY connections that must be wired. However, with the magic from the I2C module, you can drastically minimize the amount of pins needed by the Arduino.

It works by wiring 2 pins: SDA and SCL to analog pins A4 and A5 respectively. Afterwards, you must use a special library to interact with the LCD. 

That library is called '<LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>'

I also learned about the random function in Arduino, which allows for the generation of random numbers. I needed to it creste the verification system where user must input the code as proof that they are awake and attentive. 
### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned more about LCD and Arduino language. Lots of fun!
