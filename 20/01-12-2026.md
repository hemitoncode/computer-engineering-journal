## Serial Communication 

### Introduction:
Today, I shifted back to the SafeDrive project. I am building out the AI system alongside the hardware components associated with it. 

### Learning/Reflection:

My AI system uses Python and is heavy in memory. This means it cannot be uploaded into the Arduino itself. Instead, the Python program uses the pyserial module to communicate with it. You use the port that the Arduino connects too. With that port, you set up communication with your project.

Once the port is established, Python can send data to the Arduino, such as control signals for motors or LEDs, and receive sensor readings in real time.

I learned that communication must be carefully timed and structured: the Arduino continuously listens for incoming signals, while Python has to correctly format the data to avoid misinterpretation. Even small errors in data type, delimiters, or timing can cause the Arduino to behave unpredictably

This type of communication is mostly useful for sending small packets of data (nothing too large/intensive)

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned everything I need to know to establish communication between Python and my Arduino project.
