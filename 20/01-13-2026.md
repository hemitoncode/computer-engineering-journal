## The Keypad

### Introduction:
Today, I worked on implementing the keypad into my project.

### Learning/Reflection:

Keys are arranged in rows and columns. When you press a key, it connects one row to one column, allowing the program to understand which specific location you pressed. 

In your Arduino code, you can write all of the logic for this yourself, but that is quite tedious, so there exists the `<Keyboard.h>` lib, allowing the code to be abstracted, and you to focus on the actual project itself.

You need to define all of your digital pins, which will be associated to rows and columns. From there, you need to make a mapping of all of the different keys within the pad.

Here is an example of how the code would look:

```ino
#include <Keypad.h>

const byte ROWS = 4;
const byte COLS = 4;

char keys[ROWS][COLS] = {
  {'1','2','3','A'},
  {'4','5','6','B'},
  {'7','8','9','C'},
  {'*','0','#','D'}
};

byte rowPins[ROWS] = {9, 8, 7, 6};
byte colPins[COLS] = {5, 4, 3, 2};

Keypad keypad = Keypad(makeKeymap(keys), rowPins, colPins, ROWS, COLS);

void loop() {
  char key = keypad.getKey();
  if (key) {
    Serial.println(key);
  }
}

```
### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned how to tinker with keypads!
