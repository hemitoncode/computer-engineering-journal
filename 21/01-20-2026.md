## What is the terminal

### Introduction:
Today, I set up a computer and its terminal for the token-based queue system that I am developing for Mr.C

### Learning/Reflection:

The terminal is an app that allows you to interact with different programs through text-programs. In my case, I have built a program with Python.

This is how you can do it by uploading a script to the library module (place where code is kept) which is *PIP*

1) Create a minimal project layout

```
mycli/
  pyproject.toml
  README.md
  src/
    mycli/
      __init__.py
      cli.py
```

```python
src/mycli/cli.py:
def main():
    print("Hello from my CLI!")
```
### 2) Add a pyproject.toml with a CLI entry point

```python
pyproject.toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "mycli-<your-unique-name>"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A tiny example CLI"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.9"

[project.scripts]
mycli = "mycli.cli:main"
````

[project.scripts] is the modern way to create a command that runs a Python function (it maps to console_scripts).

3) Build the package (wheel + source dist)

From inside the mycli/ folder:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade build
python -m build
```

You should now have a dist/ folder with files like:

```
.whl (wheel)

.tar.gz (sdist)
```

4) Upload to TestPyPI first (recommended)

Install twine:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade twine
```

Upload:

```bash
python -m twine upload -r testpypi dist/*
```

That -r testpypi workflow is standard.

5) Create a PyPI API token (so uploads work)

On PyPI, make an API token and use it with:
```zsh
username: __token__

password: your token (starts with pypi-...)
```
(You can either type it when prompted by twine, or set environment variables like TWINE_USERNAME and TWINE_PASSWORD.)

6) Upload to real PyPI

```bash
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

7) Install and run your CLI

After upload, anyone can do:

```bash
python -m pip install mycli-<your-unique-name>
mycli
```
### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned how to build a CLI tool for my Arduino bluetooth project.
