## Soldering Safety

### Introduction:
Today we went through the safety needed to operate soldering iron. 

### Learning/Reflections:
It is important to go through these procedures because the soldering iron poses a real threat of burning one's skin. You always assume that the **solder iron IS HOT.** Therefore, you never touch the metal part where the iron is placed, rather you grab the handle and the base of the iron which will always remain cold. Always work on the wood desks. Before soldering, ensure your workplace is free of clutter. Once that is done, grab your iron (the right way). Grab your other materials too like your third arm, mat (so the wood surface does not burn), wire mesh cleaner, and a fan to blow the harmful fumes produced by the iron. **KEEP THE BAG OF THE FAN AWAY FROM YOUR WORKSPACE**

Before starting the solder, perform a physical wire check to ensure no exposed wires are present on your solder iron and fan. Grab a plyer and ensure the screw on the iron is tight enough, or else the soldering won't be done properly. Always twist the iron itself, not the plyer. **NEVER TOUCH THE SCREW YOURSELF BECAUSE WE ASSUME IRON IS HOT** Then plug them in. Ensure it is plugged in so that the solder iron would never touch the wires (a hazard). Ensure your fan is on as well.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I am prepared to safely solder my electrical connections.
