## Western Union Splice

### Introduction:

Today, I learned about the Western Union Splice and Mr.C did a demo on soldering. 

### Learning/Reflections:

The Western Union Splice is used to connect 2 electrical wires snuggly. It was named for Western Union, a telegraph company which is present-day The Western Union, a financial company specializing in wire transfers. 

To properly do it, you must cross the 2 wires. Put this cross in a plyer so they are stable enough to work on. Then you have to twist each wire around the other in a sprial. Before you do this, ensure you strip the insluation around the wire so the metal part is exposed (where the electricty actaully conducts). If the spirals you make are far part, use a flyer to push them inwards so that everything is nice and close. Otherwise, there is risk of having blobs of solder which won't create a good connection. 

To make this connection permenant, you must use soldering which is why we had to create these connections (in anticipation for tomorrow's demo).

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned about the Western Union Splice and watched the demo on soldering. I will take more about soldering in tommrrow's diary entry!
