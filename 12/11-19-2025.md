## Soldering Basics (my failures)

### Introduction:
Today, I performed a demo for Mr.C on soldering. I did not do well, but I learned how to properly solder an electrical connection from this failure.

### Learning/Reflections:

It was my first time touching a soldering iron. I did the safety bits perfectly due to my previous training, but I did not do well in applying the solder. I tinned the solder and cleaned it every couple of seconds, ensuring a proper connection could be made. However, I failed to put my iron at the bottom of the connection and lightly tap my solder from the top, allowing it to gracefully melt onto the connection. This led to a prolonged period of time being spent in applying it, and a low quality of work being produced. 

I will ask for extra practice and feedback on my work to gain better insight and do better! 

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned how to properly solder components after my failure to do it properly today.
