## Arduino Buzzer Game 

### Introduction:
Today, I finished the final touches on the buzzer game project I have been working on with Mr.C

### Learning/Reflections:

This project has helped me understand Arudino and circuits a lot better. One noteworthy thing I learned was the fact that electrical components can take + flow of current from an extrenal power source, so long as the ground is connected to the arudino itself. 

This way, the arudino can still control the component, but its power is derived from a larger power source, allowing me to use more power hungary components like the neo pixel LEDs. 

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned how circuits work better in the context of Arduino
