## Soldering Safety Activity

### Introduction:
Today, I finished the soldering safety in-class activity. 

### Learning/Reflections:
We watched the following videos:

Task 1: 
**RULES/BEST PRACTICES FOR SOLDERING:**

- Wear glasses to protect your eyes from solder popping. Regular glasses will not work because they will crack and shards of glasses would still enter your eyes. Therefore, **EVERYONE MUST WEAR GLASSES**
- **DO NOT** make contact with the solder and the soldering iron when applying the solder. Instead, you must put the iron on one side of the connection and apply the solder on the other side. The heat of the iron is what causes the solder to melt, not the IRON itself.
- Ensure you apply a bit of solder to the tip of the iron (tinning). A well-tinned tip can transfer heat more efficiently to the joint, making applying solder a much more enjoyable process.
- **NEVER** put a blob of solder onto your iron (when tinning) and attempt to transfer that solder onto your connection. The iron's main function is to provide heat for the solder to melt onto the connection, not apply the solder **DIRECTLY**. You made this mistake in your demo, leading to poor quality of work.
- **PULL AWAY THE SOLDER WIRE** first, then remove the iron. This way the solder is given enough time to fully melt and fuse the connection properly. 
- Give the connection a couple of seconds to cool down. This is done to ensure the solder properly applies itself onto the connection. 
- Lead based solder melts at a lower temperature, making it a suitable choice for lower-end soldering irons (which do not heat up that much)
- **Lead based** solder is toxic, so never eat or drink near your workstation. This includes **WATER** AS IT CAN POISON YOU!
- Solder is a hallow metal with a substance called rosin/flux filling it up. It helps improve the quality of the solder by reducing oxidation.
- You must tin the tip of your solder regularly to ensure the iron is effective in its heat transfer. Do it every 4-6 seconds. 
- You need to clean the tip of the solder whenever you need to retin your solder or else it will oxidize and corrode, hindering its ability to heat up a connection/joint. Use a wire mesh cleaner and throughouly rub on it to make the tip shiny and ready for new tinning.


- **A REALLY GOOD PIECE OF ADVICE**: Use the flat edge of the soldering iron by holding it at a shallow angle. Apply a **gentle** pressure via the iron.

Also... KEEP THE IRON STATIONARY (DO NOT MOVE IT) when applying solder. If you need to cover another area of the connection, clean, retin and apply the refreshed iron to that target area. 

Give it a couple of seconds before applying the solder. This is done to ensure the connection is hot enough for the metal alloy to melt.

Task 2: **How You Would Solder Safely**

- Grab your PPE. This includes safety goggles to protect your eyes.
- Ensure your workspace is clean.
- Grab your equipment. This includes a wire mesh cleaner, 3rd arm, soldering iron, solder, mat to perform work on. Ensure you grab your iron through the handle and base of stand. Never touch the metal parts because we assume that it is **always hot**
- Never put the plastic bag of the fan on the workspace. Keep in pocket or on non-workstation desk. 
- Perform a physical check of the wires. If there is exposed wire, **report to Mr.C immediately**. For the fan, if there is a burn mark, you should be concerned as well.
- Grab a plyer and twist the screw on the iron. Ensure you twist the iron not the plyer. This is to ensure that the iron is fully connected to give you a good connection.
- Plug everything in. You will know that the iron is heating up if the fan turns on in the same plugging area.
- Clean the tip of the iron. Apply fresh solder to the tip (tinning). 
- Start soldering.
- After every couple of seconds of applying solder, clean the tip and retin to ensure proper heat transfer all the time.
- Once done, plug everything out.
- Grab the iron via the same way. This time we don't assume that the iron is hot, **WE KNOW IT IS**
- Put everything away in its designated spot.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned how to properly solder components after my failure to do it properly today.
