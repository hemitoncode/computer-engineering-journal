## Few Shot Prompting

### Introduction:
Today we did some more practice in soldering. I am starting to get it, but I made some of the same mistakes again. That will become more of a rarity with more practice!

### Learning/Reflections:
Since it was just more practice and a early release day, I decided to read about few shot prompting within AI. Few shot prompting allows you to create a specalized AI model without any fine tuning/extra training. You simply provide 3-5 examples of what you wish the AI to do. Then you should outline what the input is (from the user), the expected output, and for the AI to use the examples to guide its text generation. 

Here is an analysis of an example few shot prompt:

```
Generate a rhyming couplet about a tree.

Here are some examples to help guide text generation:

Input: "cat" Output: The curious cat, so sleek and fat, curled up cozy on the welcome mat.
Input: "sky" Output: Look up high into the endless sky, where birds and clouds go drifting by.

With these examples in mind, do the following task:

User Input: "tree"
Your Output: generate the couplet
```


In this few shot prompt, I first gave it **instructions** which allows the AI to understand the context of the work it will be doing. Afterwards, I told it that I will provide some examples. You must tell this explicity so the AI understands what is going on (it is not a human, so it needs proper instructions). Then, give those examples. Afterwards, give it the specific task that it needs to do. Like the rest of the prompt, before you give it user input and the expected output, tell it that it is time for the AI to complete the task.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned how to prompt AI agents better!
