## Work Period - Video

### Introduction:
Today, I worked on editing my video project for reassembling and installing OS on the PC.

### Learning/Reflection:
I picked DaVinci Resolve because it is very powerful and quite easy to get started. Though there are advanced features which might alarm a novice user, you can easily learn them after using the platform for 2-3 weeks consistently.

Some things I learned today were how to split clips into 2, so I can get rid of unwanted parts within my recording. You simply have to press CTRL + B (on Windows/Linux) or CMD + B (on MacBook). 

I also learned about the inspector panel. It allows me to rotate and zoom into my clips, which allowed me to make my vertical clips into horizontal ones, so they look more uniform with the rest of my recordings. 

Finally, I learned the importance of having a timeline before editing. Video editing goes beyond fancy coloring tools and powerful editors. It's main objective is to create a story for a viewer to enjoy through meaningfully adding multiple clips together.
