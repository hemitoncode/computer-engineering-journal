## The PC Running :)

### Introduction:
Our PC is fully reassumbled, so we decided to boot into our BIOS settings and attempt to run a OS (we didn't have enough time, so we will do this next class!). Unfournately, there were some issues when we tried to boot our PC, so we needed to fix them.

### Learning/Reflection:

When we initially started our computer, the PC did not start up. This meant that there was an issue with the PSU. So, we decided to do some debugging. When we opened our chassis, we realized that there are 2 connectors for the PSU. When we looked at our reference picture again, it confirmed our suspicion. So, we had to connect the second connector to the motherboard, and once we put everything back together, the PC booted up!

To access our BIOS menu, we initially thought it was F12 since many PCs (including mines) use that keystroke. Unfournately, that was not the case. Instead, the actual keystroke was the DEL key. So, we had to click that key when the computer is in the boot up process, and when we did that, the menu popped up, as pictured below!

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, today's class was a mix of debugging and opening the BIOS GUI.
