## Reassemble the PC!

### Introduction:
Today, we had a work period where we reassumbled our 2012 Acer tower PC. 

### Learning/Reflection:
Kunj worked on the parts while I was in charge of recording and ensuring Kunj was removing the right parts. Whilst we were reassembling the PSU (Power Supply Unit), I learned that there are multiple wires which can be used for different motherboards as a PSU is cross compitable with multiple other motherboards. This means that though there are many different cables coming out of the PSU component, we only need to connect one into the motherboard as the others are for other models of motherboards. 

We also only removed the screws outside of the internal components. Though there were screws on the PSU itself, these weren't meant to be removed because that would disassemble the PSU into different components, and we might break it. 

### Picture of PSU:

As you can see, the PSU has multiple cables, but not all of these are to be used when reassembling a PC.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, we learned about the role of the PSU and we saw its cross comptability in action!
