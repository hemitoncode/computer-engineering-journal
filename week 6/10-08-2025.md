## The Operating System

### Introduction:
Today, me and Kunj installed the Windows operating system onto our PC.

### Learning/Reflection:
We first inserted the Windows installer into the I/O port. Then we went into our BIOS menu through DEL key. With our specific motherboard, we only needed to disable the warning of open chasis. Once these settings were configured, we can exit out of the setup, and boot into the the boot menu through F12. There we saw the "Generic Flash" identifer which points to our USB stick, so we click on that option and boot into the Windows installation. Then, we simply need to go through installing and configuring Windows within the PC. Since this PC does not have a network card, we click "I don't have internet" at the bottom. 

Once everything is configured, we can remove the USB stick as the OS is now stored in the HDD. To remove the OS, we need to plug the USB stick again and go through the installer window. When we get to the disk parititon, you should see your HDD. Delete that paritition and then cancel the installation process, which will remove the operating system from the memory fully. 

**YOU CANNOT RESET THE PC AS THAT WILL NOT REMOVE THE OPERATING SYSTEM**

### Conclusion:
In conlcusion, I learned how to install Windows and delete it from a PC.
