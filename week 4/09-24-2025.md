## Fans on the PSU??:

### Introduction:
Today, Pransu and his group presented their escape room game.

### Learning/Reflection:
I was not responsible for researching PSU, so I learned something new about it. I learned that PSU overheats **A LOT,** so it is necessary to have some sort of cooling system. This is why the PSU has an in-built fan which will function a lot like the CPU fan. It will first capture the heat and then blow it away, outside of the component.  

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned about the fans role in keeping the PSU functional :)
