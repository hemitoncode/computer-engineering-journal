## Fans on the PSU??:

### Introduction:
Today, Pransu and his group presented their escape room game.

### Learning/Reflection:
I was not responsible for researching PSU, so I learned something new about it. I learned that PSU overheats **A LOT,** so it is necessary to have some sort of cooling system. This is why the PSU has an in-built fan which will function a lot like the CPU fan. It will first capture the heat and then blow it away, outside of the component.  

The PSU would become damaged if it were to overheat because it contains capacitors which store and smooth out electricity. When these components are exposed to this excessive heat, it will cause them to degrade (bulge, break, leak, or fail). This will hinder the PSU's ability to give stable electricity as the electricity isn't smoothend out anymore.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned about the fans role in keeping the PSU functional :)
