## Super AI: How RAG Systems Change the Game!

### Introduction:
Today, it was my group's turn to present. Because of that, I decided to read an article in technology and post my reflections to this journal.

### Learning/Reflection:
AI has a HUGE problem. It is trained on general data, so if you give it a hyper spefic response which it doesn't understand, it will make something up (often known as hallucinating). This is a dangerous practice, especially as company's start integrating AI tools into essential professions like aerospace engineering, where a simple mistake can mean 1000s of lives gone. Fournately, there is a **solution**! 

Introducing the exciting world of RAG! RAG, or Retrieval Augemented Generation allows a developer to input added context to the prompt of an AI agent. The AI can now use this context as the very foundation of its answer. Here's how it works...

To actually gather the right context, the RAG system must find text through **semantic searching,** which means it finds text that has similar meanings/concepts as your query. To do this, you need a vector database which stores vector embeddings that represent different texts of your document.

- Generate **vector embeddings*** of your files and documents surrounding your niche topic (i.e. internal files) through an embedding model (distinct AI model)
- Store these **vector embeddings** to your vector db
- When user inputs a query, find similar vector embeddings from this vector db, and store its text as context.
- Use this newly stored context to generate an accurate AI response!

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned that motherboards can be branded, and the brand of ROG by Taiwan company, Asus.
