## Eleven Labs:

### Introduction:
Today, we had a work period on our game project. I decided to add an AI voiceover for my project. 

### Learning/Reflection:
I was searching for some good tools to accomplish this task, and that is when I came accross Eleven Labs. This website has built AI models that replicate human speech quite well, for very little to no cost! I used the Eleven v3 (alpha) model to generate all my voices. 

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned the new and exciting world of AI-generated voices!
