## Eleven Labs:

### Introduction:
Today, we had a work period on our game project. I decided to add an AI voiceover for my project. 

### Learning/Reflection:
I was searching for some good tools to accomplish this task, and that is when I came accross Eleven Labs. This website has built AI models that replicate human speech quite well, for very little to no cost! I used the Eleven v3 (alpha) model to generate all my voices. 

I also learned that there are credits to use these services. I was granted a total of 10,000 credits, and once these credits are completed, I was revoked access to the service. To regain access to it, I would have to pay for another 1,000 credits. To bypass this system, I simply made new accounts everytime I ran out of the free 10,000 credits, saving me about 5-6 dollars. 

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned the new and exciting world of AI-generated voices!
