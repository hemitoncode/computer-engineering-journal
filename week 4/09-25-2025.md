## The Amazing World of ROG

### Introduction:
Today, Siddh and his group did their game project. Their game involved building a PC through different components we can collect through a board game. 

### Learning/Reflection:
During the game, I learned about the Asus ROG (Republic of Gamers) branding, which is a series of gaming hardwares produced by Taiwanese company Asus. They are well-known for their high-end motherboards, which came as a bit of a shock to me as I thought motherboards were mostly unbranded. They have engineered their motherboards to become most optimized for heavy computer usage (i.e. gaming or AI stuff). For example, they have overclocking tools which make it easy to run your CPU at higher speeds then intended by the manufactuerer for intense gaming sessions or training an AI model with some data. They also look aesthically pleasing with colorful branding all over the motherboard. Regular motherboards would not invest money into this as the user would never see it, but many gamers have a transparent PC case, making it essential to have components look good. There is also a high quality power supply which can deliver the necessary power in an efficient manner.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned that motherboards can be branded, and the brand of ROG by Taiwan company, Asus.
