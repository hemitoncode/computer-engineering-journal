## BIOS Explored!!!:

### Introduction:
Today, Prisha and her group presented their game project. It was pretty fun, and I learned something new in BIOS. 

### Learning/Reflection:
Since I was not responsible in researching the BIOS component, I had a very limited knowledge on it. I thought it was used to test the CPU functionality only. However, I learned that the BIOS performs a process called **Power-On Self-Test (POST).** It is basically a testing process that ensures **ALL** hardware components are working in proper-order.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I became more informed onto what the BIOS component does!
