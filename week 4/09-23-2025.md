## BIOS Explored!!!:

### Introduction:
Today, Prisha and her group presented their game project. It was pretty fun, and I learned something new in BIOS. 

### Learning/Reflection:
Since I was not responsible in researching the BIOS component, I had a very limited knowledge on it. I thought it was used to test the CPU functionality only. However, I learned that the BIOS performs a process called **Power-On Self-Test (POST).** It is basically a testing process that ensures **ALL** hardware components are working in proper-order. 

It only initalizes the Operating System, so the computer can become functional for the user. I also learned that the BIOS is attached directly to the mother as a chip. I personally thought the BIOS was within the CPU, not a seperate entity.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I became more informed onto what the BIOS component does, and the form it possesses.
