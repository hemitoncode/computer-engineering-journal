## Put the SATA cables in properly!!!

### Introduction:
Mr.C conducted an inspection of our PC to ensure we added everything correctly. Most of it was fine, but we put the SATA cable for the optical drive incorrectly.

### Learning/Reflection:
First off, what is a SATA cable? 

It is a cable that connects the storage device (HDD or SSD) to the motherboard, so that it can be used by other computer components like the CPU. Therefore, you must connect the cable to **both** the components *PROPERLY* for it to work. 


Unfourtnately, we put the wrong side of the SATA cable into the motherboard for our optical drive. Mr.C helped us realize that the angled part of the SATA cable must go into the storage device (in this case the optical drive) and the flat connector should be inserted into the optical drive itself. 

Once this was done, our configuration for the computer was completed successfully!

### Conclusion:
We learned how to properly connect the SATA cable to motherboard and storage device.
