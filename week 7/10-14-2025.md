## Water usage of AI

### Introduction:
I spent the period editing my video, so I decided to read an article and post my relections here. 

### Learning/Reflection:
Datacenters host AI models. When running them, they do lots of complex computations, and because of this, it requires a lot of cooling. This is where the water cooling system comes into play. It absorbs the heat produced by the datacenter, leading to it becoming cooler. This water becomes warm now, so it is useless. This is why it is evaporated into air, leading to less readily available liquid water.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned how water is used to help AI function.
