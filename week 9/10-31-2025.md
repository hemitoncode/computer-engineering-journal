## Arduino -> INPUT_PULLUP 

### Introduction:
Today, I designed a circuit for a buzzer game. Within it, I had to use buttons, so I learned about a new pin mode I can code within the C++ program powering my mircocontroller. 

### Learning/Reflections:
Using ```INPUT_PULLUP``` allows me to accept inputs where I keep a pin HIGH by default, and whenever the button is pressed (completing the circuit), the pin becomes LOW. I can then employ an if statement within my code to track this state change and execute different logic based on it. 


This experience also solidified my understanding of how buttons work. Essentially, they complete a circuit by pressing a metal piece. That is why when you keep pressing a button, the circuit keeps doing what it was designed to do because the flow of current isn't being blocked. However, when you let go of the button, the metal piece moves away from the circuit, which cuts the flow of current, rendering that part of your project useless (exactly how you should want it). 


In my case, I had buttons in their own separate circuits. When a user presses it, the flow of current completes and the digital pin becomes LOW (due to Arduino programming), and based on my if statement, another circuit within my project completes a specific task, like the NeoPixel components lighting up. 

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I am a master in buttons and the engineering behind them!
