## Conversions + Resistor

### Introduction:
Today we learned about the different conversions we can make to the base value (V, ohms, and A) and how to determine resistance and accuracy of resistance for a resistor through a color coded diagram on the component.

### Learning/Reflections:

To start, we learned the different "sub" units to the base values. These make it easier to represent very LARGE base values and very low ones. 

There are 6 to keep in mind:

- Giga (highest) and (10^9)
- Mega (10^6)
- Kilo (10^3)
- Base Value (10^0)
- Mili (10^-3)
- Mirco (10^-6)
- Nano (lowest) and (10^-9)

If you haven't noticed by now, the values jump the number by 3 decimal places, so you can move the decimal place accordingly. Personally, I find it much easier to just multiply the current value with the multiplier to get the new sub unit. To do this, find the exponent value for old - new and then multiply by the current vlaue with 10 to the power of that new calculated value.

For example, convert 43 kA to MA

kA => 3
MA = 6

Exponent value => 3-6 = -3
43 kA * 10^-3 = 0.043 MA

### Conclusion:
