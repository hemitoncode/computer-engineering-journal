## Cache memory... WHAT?:

### Introduction:
Today, we had a work period on our game project. We were discussing the details surrounding a CPU and I came to learn that a CPU helps a computer run faster through something called a memory cache.

### Learning/Reflection:
I learned that memory cache is a very small but fast type of memory which sits closer to the CPU then the RAM, meaning it is faster then even the RAM. It's main job is to store frequently used instructions, so that the CPU doesn't have to keep asking the RAM for it.
<br>
There are 3 types of levels of memory cache:
- L1 (the smallest in storage but fastest)
- L2 (larger storage but slower than L1)
- L3 (largest storage but the slowest type of memory cache)

Essentially, cache memory is important to a computer because it helps increase performance for tasks that the user frequently does. 

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned about memory cache and its purpose in the CPU
