## Electrons in SSDs??:

### Introduction:
Today, we had a work period on our game project. I brushed up my work on the SSD by researching more in-depth as to what it ACTUALLY does to store information. 

### Learning/Reflection:
I learned that the SSD has something called floating gate transistors which basically trap electrons into a chip stored within the SSD, called the NAND flash memory. If there is a presence of electrons, it represents 1 and vice-versa. This helps model the on and off singals computer need to understand/compute information. 
<br>
This is how the SSD can store information without having electfical signals to charge the on/off signals. It uses another medium (electrons) to represent the on/off signals and then they are converted to electricla swingals when processed by the computer itself.
### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned about SSD and NAND flash memory's role in helping its functionality.
