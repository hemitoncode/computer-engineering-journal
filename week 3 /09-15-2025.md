## GPUs: CPUs are steroids??:

### Introduction:
Today, we had a work period on our game project. We did some extra research on the 8 components to hopefully earn better marks. Amidst our research, we realized that GPUs have something called "parrelel" computing.

### Learning/Reflection:
Researchers were able to make a chip that can transmit information through light instead of electricity for convlutions. Convlutions is how an AI system processes complex data such as videos, pictures, and the meaning behind words within different languages. Using Frenzel's lenses, the chip directs the light in a way so it performs the calculation almost automatically through physics. 

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, light can now be used to perform complex calculations needed to run AI models, and it will change the chip industry forever!
