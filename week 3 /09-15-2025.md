## RAM BROKE???:

### Introduction:
Today, we had a work period on our game project. We did some extra research on the 8 components to hopefully earn better marks. Amidst our research, we came accross the concept of "virtual memory"

### Learning/Reflection:
When your computer runs out of RAM, it will often struggle to run your programs properly because the program would switch from fast RAM memory to the slow, cumbersome HDD or SSD. This is because RAM is physically connected to the motherboard, whilst an SSD or HDD is connected through a wire, meaning that there is more distance they have to cover before they can communicate with other connected components. 

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned in new concept within RAM components, expanding my knowledgebase about computers! (Hopefully it will help me in my post-secondary computer engineering studies)
