## Bridges in computers??:

### Introduction:
Today, we had a work period on our game project. We worked on completing the 15 questions and ensuring everyone completed their allocated work. I had a conversation with Azmeer about his work with motherboards. 

### Learning/Reflection:
I learned that motherboards have a Southbridge and a Northbridge. The Southbridge manages input/output (I/O) devices such as USB ports, hard drives, and audio. The Northbridge handles faster connections like CPU, RAM, and graphics card. I also learned about connectors which are physical ports and slots that establish an electrical connection which allows everything to run properly.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned about Southbridge, Northbridge, and connectors!
