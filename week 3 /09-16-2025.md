### Introduction:
Today, we had a work period on our game project. We worked on designing our game itself. There was no learning within class as we have already compeleted the research components task, so I decided to read an article about something within the tech industry. The link to said article is below.

### Learning/Reflection:
IBM is launching a new tool called Watson for Cyber Security which is a cloud-based verison of their Waston system. It is spefically designed to handle cyber-security tasks, and it will help I.T. professionals complete their job in a more effienct manner. Oftentimes, professionals are stuck reading lengthly reports and numbers which waste their valuable resources, so Waston for Cyber Security will be completing those tasks for them!
### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned about a new project happening with the Cyber-Security/Computer space!
