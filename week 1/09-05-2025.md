## Are computers truly smart?

### Introduction:

In class today, we discussed the capabilties of computers. Do they truly possess intelligence, or are they simply obdient rule-followers programmed by humans?

## Learning:

After an insightful class discussion, we concluded that a computer just follows a set of rules which is deliered through a computer programmer. Computers are also incapable of having a conscious, so they cannot make ethical or moral decisons. Even intelligent AI models are based on a set of mathematical rules which dynamically update the programming and training of the AI. 

## Conclusion:

In conclusion, computers are powerful but unable to think like humans do.
