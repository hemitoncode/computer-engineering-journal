## Power should remain the same?? 

### Introduction:
Today, we explored a problem regarding a series circuit. If all light bulbs held the same amount of resistance, would they bright the same? **ANSWER: YES**.

### Learning/Reflections:
In a series circuit, all components are connected end-to-end in a single path. That means there is only one path for current to flow. 

Let's look at this mathematically. 

Let's say current for the series circuit is 4 A. It should remain consistent in all places of the circuit. Let's say there are 3 light bulbs, all with 10 ohms resistance. 

To find power (how much work is done to make it bright), we can use the formula I^2 * R. 

This means all values will have a power of 160 W **per bulb** for a total of 480 W of power.

If you were to follow the path of current using your pencil, it would only have one way to go. 

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned how to apply an important property of series circuit to understand how loads within it would operate based on given constraints (i.e same resistance over all loads)
