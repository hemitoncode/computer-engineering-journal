## Avrdude

### Introduction:
Today, I was doing some troubleshooting and noticed that the errors started with "avrdude:" so naturally I was curious to know as to what this exactly means. 

Avrdude indicates that there is a *communication* error between the IDE software (code editor) and the mircocontroller on the Arduino board during the upload process. It specifically comes from the AVR Downloader Uploader utility program which the IDE utilizes to upload the code into the board's memory. 

If such an error happens, make sure that you check for fauly USB connections (most common errors) or if a driver for USB chip of the Arudino board is not installed on your computer. 

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned about the AVR Downloader Uploader program and more broadly how Arudino IDE uploads code into the Arudino
