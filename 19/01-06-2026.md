## Roboflow x YOLO Magic

### Introduction:
Training computer vision models is a computationally expensive task which requires very expensive hardware, so it is pretty much impossible or very difficult/long for me to do it myself. Instead, I will use hardware from Roboflow to run my AI training. 

Roboflow allows me to rent hardware to use for training different CV models, but they do have a free tier which I intend on abusing (haha). 

YOLO is a set of CV models which are general-purpose. This means they have been trained with images of various scenarios, so they are amazing at general problems, but for specific use-cases, they will struggle. This is why we need to perform something called *fine-tuning* which updates the parameters of the model to become competent in that one task (which are just numbers that determine the output of AI and are updated in training). 

However, this removes the configuration that did good at general-purpose tasks which means that the model performance will suffer in that regard. 

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned about YOLO and how I can use Roboflow to fine-tune the model.
