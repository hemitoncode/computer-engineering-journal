## L289n motor driver

### Introduction:
Today I started working on the training modules. My job is to create instructional content based off of the L289n motor and IR sensors so we can create a line following robot. 

### Learning/Reflection:

I started off today with learning just the basics of the pins. This way I have a good idea of what I need to get this project started. On the sides, there are 2 blue screws where we put the cables for our DC motors. Porality does not matter and we configure it later on within the Arduino code. You can connect this motor to an external power supply since it might need more than the 5v Arduino gives. To do that just place the power supply cables into the 12v and GND. To ensure Arduino is connected, connect a wire to VIN on the board. 

There are ENA, ENB, and IN1,2,3, and 4 pins as well. Those are needed to control the speed and direction of the motor and thus connected with digital pins within Arduino. Ensure that ENA and ENB are put into PWM supporting pins because they need a range of values (0-255). 

Next steps:
- Properly connect the external power supply
- Run Arudino code to see if motor runs
- Configure IR sensors to be receptive of black lines and other colors
- Ultrasonic sensor (potentially?? I am not here for a couple of days, so I might not get enough time to work on this. I will do it in next semester during my lunch periods though!)

I need to also keep written records of everything so that I can build modules from there for easy learning.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned more about the L289n motor driver which is used to help program a DC motor with Arduno
