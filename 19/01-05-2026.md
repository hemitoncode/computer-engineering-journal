## Back from break :(

### Introduction:
Today, I got back from winter break. Mr.C introduced the Arduino projects to us. Since I have a good understanding of Arduino, I was not required to do the modules assigned. Instead I am going to be building projects, so I started brainstorming some ideas. I have already built a token system during the winter break, so I am going to continue improving that project. Along with that, I plan to build SafeDrive, a project which ensures that drivers do not fall asleep behind the wheel through AI technology (Computer Vision) through drowsiness detector.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, we started doing the Arduino projects.
