## New project today!

### Introduction:
We start our project today, the touch sensor! 

### Learning/Reflections:

To be honest, I am very nervous for this project because my soldering skills are pretty subpar. Therefore, I decided to get some feedback on the solder joints which I made previously by Mr.C

There were some issues to be addressed:

- **Cold joints**:

Some of my joints looked dull, grainy and lumpy. I need to touch the iron to the pad + lead for 1-2 seconds before feeding the solder into the joint. It **MUST** be tinned before doing it. 


- **Too much solder**

My joints looked like a sphere instead of a cone shape, which is due to too much solder. To create strong connections, aim to not add too much solder. **less IS MORE**

I also realized that I need to be more confident within myself. My nervousness often leads to me swaying the iron which leads to the solder splattering all over the place (where I do not want it), and it could cause a short circuit if that solder connects to another component. 

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned more about transistors and more specifically NPN transistors.
