## Mullti-meter and boards

### Introduction:
We studied multimeters and the many kinds of boards we may solder on today. Three distinct boards were taught to us:

### Learning/Reflections:

A breadboard is a board used to build temporary circuits.

Perf Board: A circuit board with perforations used to create long-term circuits. There are square copper films in a perf board that are unconnected to any other holes.

Stripboard: Another type of perforated circuit board used to construct long-term circuits. But a stripboard differs from a perf board in that every hole in a row is connected to every other hole. 

Additionally, we studied multimeters. One tool for calculating voltage, resistance, or current is a multimeter. 

We use two wires that give current a slight push in order to measure voltage, resistance, or current using a multimeter. It contains two probes, a red (positive) which connects to the VΩA input and a black (negative) wire which connects to the COM input. These probes are connected to various circuit points. The circuit must be live or on and the multimeter must be connected in parallel with the load in order to measure the voltage across a load.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, we learned about perf boards, stripboards, and multimeters.
