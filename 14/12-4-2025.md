## Transistors! 

### Introduction:
Today I learned about transistors and did some practice in implementing them to circuits within TinkerCAD breadboards. 

### Learning/Reflections:

A transistor is a tiny semiconductor which can act as a **Switch** or **Amplifier**. 

As a Switch: It controls the flow of electricity. If a small input signal is given, then only will the electric current be allowed through. You can think of it much like a valve which blocks the flow of water based on some condition (water = electricity). 

As a Amplifier: It can increase the voltage, current, or power of a signal. 

We will be working with the NPN transistor. It basically has 3 pins:

**EMITTER (E)** - sends out electrons (to negative polar of circuits)
**BASE (B)** - controls the transistor 
**COLLECTOR (C)** - recieves electrons (and does not send them unless base allows it)



### Conclusion:
In conclusion, I learned more about transistors and more specifically NPN transistors.
